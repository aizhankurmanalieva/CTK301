		<h2>Welcome!</h2>
		<p>I don't know what you did, Fry, but once again, you screwed up! Now all the planets are gonna start cracking wise about our mamas. Yep, I remember. They came in last at the Olympics, then retired to promote alcoholic beverages! Do a flip! Oh, all right</a>, I am. But if anything happens to me, tell them I died robbing some old man. Does anybody else feel jealous and aroused and worried? When will that be? Kids don't turn rotten just from watching TV. That's a popular name today. Little "e", big "B"? You'll have all the Slurm you can drink when you're partying with Slurms McKenzie! Ah, the 'Breakfast Club' soundtrack!  I can't wait til I'm old enough to feel ways about stuff! Check it out, y'all. Everyone who was invited is here. You wouldn't. Ask anyway!</p>

    <p><a href="fake link"> Dan Flahes.</a> It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy.</p>

		<p>To be, or not to be, that is the question:
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles
And by opposing end them. To dieâ€”to sleep,
no more; and by a sleep to say we end.</p>
